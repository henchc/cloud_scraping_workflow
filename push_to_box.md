# Push scraped files from remote server to Box account
(Adapted from [BRC directions](https://github.com/ucberkeley/brc-draft-documentation/wiki/Transferring-Data-Between-Savio-and-Your-UC-Berkeley-Box-Account) to transfer from Savio)

First zip together all the files you want to push to Box, you can't (or don't want to) `put` a file structure.

~~~
zip -r name_of_zip.zip scraped_files/
~~~

If your zip file will exceeds the allotted maximum file size, you can split your zip file. For 1GB files:

~~~
zip -r -s 1000m name_of_zip.zip scraped_files/
~~~

Alternatively with TAR:

~~~
# split into 5GB files
tar cvzf - Directory/ | split -b 5000m - test.tgz

# to later combine TAR parts and untar
cat test.tgz* > all_test.tgz
tar -xvzf all_test.tgz
~~~

Now we use [LFTP](http://lftp.tech) to push the zip file to Box:

~~~
lftp ftp.box.com
~~~

For encryption:

~~~
set ssl-allow true
~~~

Then enter you username and password.

~~~
user your_name@berkeley.edu
~~~

You can now use basic bash commands to navigate the file structure of your Box account. Use `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, and `mkdir` to create a new directory and navigate into it. Then to transfer the file into the working directory of your Box account we use `put`: 

~~~
put name_of_zip.zip
~~~
